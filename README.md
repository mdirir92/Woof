I've built a system that allows users to rate dogs based on the [Dog CEO API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/).

- Users are able to browse all the breeds available on the Dog CEO API
- Users are able to view random dogs, either overall or by breeds from Dog CEO API
- Users can add dogs to my favorite list
- Users can add a rating to the dog
- Users can see the overall rating of the dog
